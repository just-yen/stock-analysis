# **Stock-Analysis With Excel VBA**

## Overview 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to refactor and edit a pre existing code used in Microsoft Excel VBA to determine what stocks are worth investing in 2017 and 2018. This was determined through comparing return and total daily volumes of the stocks. 

### Results 

Chart headers, ticker arrays, input boxes, conditional formatting, and clear codes were copied from the original code before the refactoring code was created. 

Refactoring code can be found on [VBA_Challenge](https://github.com/just-yen/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) on Module 2. 

Below is a comparison of the original code vs refactoring code.

## Summary 

### Refactoring Code: Advantages and Disadvantages 

Advantages to refactoring code makes it easier to read and decreases the run time for the code. By reducing the amount of code that is needed it will use less memory which will increase the efficiency of the code. Additionally, it will be easier for any user to read as the logic will be easier to follow along with the additions of comments. 

Disadvantages to refactoring code may result an increase in risk to deliverables and time frame. When refactoring a code on a larger scale it may be more time consuming to refactoring large amounts of codes. Furthermore, there will be chances of new problems being introduce to the code if not debugged properly.
